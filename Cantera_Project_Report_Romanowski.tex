		\section{Introduction}
		Subject of this project was a combustion of fuel consisting methane and ethane in various proportions. This analysis will centre on comparing maximal temperature, pressure and pressure rate in different initial conditions what could be useful for designing combustion chamber. It also can help to assure that auto-ignition will or will not take place in some situations what is important for safety security as mixtures could be to increase or decrease the auto-ignition temperature.
		
		
		\section{Model description}
		
		\subsection{Software}
		That problem was solved with usage of Cantera software for Python programming language. That library could be also used in C++, Matlab and Fortran.
		
		\subsection{Gas model}
		The gas was modelled as an ideal gas in zero-dimensional constant volume reactor. Initial state was specified by pressure, temperature and composition of fuel-air mixture. The last factor was described by fuel-air ratio and shares of methane and ethane in fuel.
		\\ Air was described as oxygen-nitrogen mixture in ratio 1:3.76. Initial temperature and pressure were described in arrow inside the code. To check how both of them independently affect the calculations result, temperature was changed for pressure of one atmosphere and pressure for temperature of 950K. 
		\\ Combustion reaction was specified by following chemical reaction for stoichiometric mixture:
		\\ \ce{aCH4 + bC2H6 + c(O2 + 3.76N2 ) -> dCO2 + eH2O + c*3.76N2}
		\\ where:
		\\ $a$ - moles of methane, also methane's share in fuel in range [0,1],
		\\ $b=1-a$ - moles of ethane, also ethane's share in fuel,
		\\ $d=a$ - moles of carbon dioxygen,
		\\ $e=2 \cdot a+3 \cdot b$ - moles of water (gaseous),
		\\ $c=(a+2 \cdot b)+(2 \cdot a+3 \cdot b)/2$ - moles of oxygen,
		\\ $c \cdot 3.76$ - moles of nitrogen which was considered as neutral gas.
		
		\subsection{Code summary}
		The code uses Cantera's IdealGasReactor which creates zero-dimensional chamber with constant volume. During simulation of each combustion process maximal temperature, pressure and pressure rate were searched and then they were added to the two-dimensional arrows which were used to create three plots of those parameters.
		\\ The parameters are shown as colours while X and Y axis stands respectively for methane's share in fuel and fuel-air ratio (generally denoted as $\Phi$).
		\\ Code is shown in section \ref{AppB}.
		
		
		\section{Results and conclusion}
		The most important results are shown in subsections included in section \ref{AppA} and all in Figures folder in repository. Each subsection is named after initial temperature and pressure.
		\\As it was suspected the highest temperatures are closely to the fuel-air ratio totals 1, because all energy contained in fuel in used in combustion process. The highest pressures and pressures rates are for $\Phi=1.5$. 
		\\Moreover, it could be spotted that in Cantera calculations the mixture has higher temperature of ignition than in assumptions. 880 K is first temperature (in 10 K steps) which had significant difference between initial and maximal pressure (5\% of the first value, which is used in definition of explosion). For 880K (figures \ref{fig:T880p1_temp}, \ref{fig:T880p1_pres} and \ref{fig:T880p1_rate}) ignition takes place only around 0.9 share of methane in mixture and fuel-air ratios higher than 4. First remark is wrong, because in paper (6) characteristics of auto-ignition temperature is linear between those temperatures for pure methane and ethane – as it is described in sources (7) and (8) 870 K for methane and 790 K for ethane. What could be seen on next figures auto-ignition takes place for pure methane from around 1050 K and for pure ethane from around 1000 K for low and medium fuel-air ratios.
		\\Beyond that problem, other observations are expected: with the increase of temperature or pressure mixture tends to burn in new compositions what is consistent with source (7). 
		\\To sum up, Cantera in this case was not a good tool to examine auto-ignition. Reason of the strange behaviour for pure alkanes is unknown and probably should be examined.
